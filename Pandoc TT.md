Allie and Jenna’s Tool Tutorial for Pandoc

#Introduction#

What is pandoc? 

A useful tool for managing and controlling your documents in a marked down format. By learning specific codes and sequences you can control your computer and preserve documents using only your keyboard. The documents you use with pandoc will survive the constantly changing faces of fancy word processing programs and the plain text format will always be accessible and readable. You can use pandoc syntax extensions to transform files into different formats and citation styles. Pandoc is like driving a car, but where you open up the hood and control each movement at the touch of your fingers, making your brain and your keyboard manipulate the codes which cause each movement to be performed seamlessly. 



- reformat files using command-line operations. For example, the .epub file that won’t open with any of your computer programs can be reformatted by panic into an .rtf file that can be opened by any text editing program.
- use templates to format your academic writing. Instead of formatting for MLA, APA, etc. as you write your papers, you can write in simple markdown format, focusing on content instead of format. Input the finished document into Pandoc and the outputted document will be formatted into the required citation style.
