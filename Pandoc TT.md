#Introduction#

What is pandoc? 

A useful tool for managing and controlling your documents in a marked down format. By learning specific codes and sequences you can control your computer and preserve documents using only your keyboard. 



a short blurb about what the tool does and why a person might want to use it
- reformat files using command-line operations. For example, the .epub file that won’t open with any of your computer programs can be reformatted by panic into an .rtf file that can be opened by any text editing program.
- use templates to format your academic writing. Instead of formatting for MLA, APA, etc. as you write your papers, you can write in simple markdown format, focusing on content instead of format. Input the finished document into Pandoc and the outputted document will be formatted into the required citation style.
