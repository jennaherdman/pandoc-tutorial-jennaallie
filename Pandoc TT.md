Allie and Jenna’s Tool Tutorial for Pandoc

#Introduction#

##What is pandoc? 

A useful tool for managing and controlling your documents in a marked down format. By learning specific codes and sequences you can control your computer and preserve documents using only your keyboard. The documents you use with pandoc will survive the constantly changing faces of fancy word processing programs and the plain text format will always be accessible and readable. You can use pandoc syntax extensions to transform files into different formats and citation styles. Pandoc is like driving a car, but where you open up the hood and control each movement at the touch of your fingers, making your brain and your keyboard manipulate the codes which cause each movement to be performed seamlessly.

Note: We will be restricting this tutorial to Mac users, for now.  


##What do we find most useful about pandoc? 

- reformat files using command-line operations. For example, the .epub file that won’t open with any of your computer programs can be reformatted by pandoc into an .rtf file that can be opened by any text editing program.
- use templates to format your academic writing. Instead of formatting for MLA, APA, etc. as you write your papers, you can write in simple markdown format, focusing on content. Input the finished document into Pandoc and the outputted document will be formatted into the required citation style. C’est magnifique! 
- Using markdown format has many advantages - for example, [David Smith’s personal blog](http://www.davidsmith.name/2014/05/23/markdown-for-the-humanities/ “David Smith’s personal blog) says that markdown forces you to write more  instead of getting distracted by formatting and citations. 

#Software & Setup

#Installation
how to install the tool or other prerequisites for using it
- there are different versions for Mac, Windows and Linux [downloadable here](http://pandoc.org/installing.html “downloadable here”)
- if you want to convert files into PDFs, the LaTeX extension is also required. For Mac users, you can download a [simple version of the program](https://tug.org/mactex/morepackages.html “simple version of the program”)

##Setup

After downloading, go through the regular procedures for installing a program. However, when you have finished, you might have difficulty finding the application for pandoc. This is because there is no graphic user interface in the way most applications we download are presented. More detailed information can be found [on the pandoc website](http://pandoc.org/getting-started.html “pandoc website”)

For Mac users, you open pandoc in /Applications/Utilities, then clicking the application called Terminal. A small, white window will open. Welcome to your new control hub!
